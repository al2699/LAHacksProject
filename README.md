### What is this?
groUp is an event compiling application. It pulls all of the campus events from MiraCosta College's website through a python webscraper and than displays it in a social-media-ish way.

This app was initially created at LAHacks 2018 in collaboration with a team of 6. We will continously be updating this project as times goes on. Please feel free to fork and contribute in the meanwhile.
